<p>We’ve got some big news: On October 8th — the one year anniversary of our Founding Member Campaign launch — we flipped the switch and began Grid Beta auto-activations. Every day this week, we’ve activated 100 new founding members who’ve begun building the first sites on the Grid. It’s been a long time in the making and we know you are anxious to get a look for yourself.</p><p>First of all, thank you. Your patience (and sometimes, impatience) and belief in the idea that everyone can have beautiful websites have been a wonderful motivator. It took us longer than we planned to get comfortable with adding anyone. We still aren’t comfortable with it but we decided it’s time. We are adding 100 new users daily. As of this writing, we have nearly 1,000 founding members actively participating in the beta.</p><p>The Grid product is in it’s infancy and is still below our standards. That’s why it was hard to let people on — because our standards are high, as we know yours will be. When we compare the vision we are building to what has been built, we see a huge gap. When we compare what we have built to existing platforms, which have taken hundreds of developers several years to grow their ecosystems, we see a smaller gap. Every day those gaps gets smaller.</p><p>We are not building a better content management system. We aren’t trying to be or beat Squarespace, Wordpress or WIX. What we are building is a different animal. A platform shaped by your content. Today, with one click, Grid users can send content to their site from any digital source; photos from an iPhone, videos from an Android device, any piece of content from anywhere on the web. From there, our AI tools are analyzing the color and context of photos, the length and language of text and the preferences set for fonts, brand and layout to deliver a site that would’ve taken thousands of dollars or hundreds of hours to achieve with existing tools and services. We aren’t happy with the results yet. But the foundation has been laid and the plumbing is in and with the help of the feedback we are receiving, it’s only a matter of time.</p><p>Frankly, we were worried that when we finally activated you, you would hate where we’ve taken things. But what we realized is that you are part of this team. You made an investment when this was just an idea. As a founder, you deserve a say in the direction of the product from an early stage. We really, really need and value your feedback. Be critical of the sites you see coming out. If something could be better, say so. When you see something promising, call it out. When you get access to the product, beat the hell out of it. Now that the vision for the Grid is within reach, we won’t rest until you’re all active and making sites we are all proud of. Then we can focus on improving something else we are unsatisfied with.</p><p>We are a startup. We are <a href="https://twitter.com/forresto/lists/grid/members" data-href="https://twitter.com/forresto/lists/grid/members">30 people</a> and growing. Every one of us is passionate about this project. Most of us left great jobs to tackle this huge challenge because we believe there can and should be a platform that puts beautiful websites within anyone’s reach. We operate as a flat, self-organizing team and are working hard to be more transparent with you so we can share as we learn from our successes and failures.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will be making our bug tracker and roadmap public. We want you to see what features and fixes are being worked on and more importantly, to see the bigger vision of where we are going with the Grid.</p><p>Here’s is some feedback we’ve been getting from new users (warts and all):</p><p>[grid-web] Feedback: The Grid — ExtensionDepending on the layout, some images are sized up beyond their max res while others are distorted depending on the column #</p><p>[grid-web] Feedback: The Grid — ExtensionSometimes when I edit a draft and upon completely I return to drafts, the page I just edited is gone. Deleted, gone. Which kinda sucks! :) But I love the direction things are headed.</p><p>ux feedbackAnother UX issue I noticed is in the drafts section, I always try to double click a draft to open it up for editing, which doesn’t work. — </p><p>[grid-web] Feedback: The Grid — ExtensionHi, The first thing I noticed when using the content editor when working on a draft is I have a habit of trying to drag and drop an image into the editor.</p><p>New Conversation</p><p>Initial feedbackHaving just started using the grid today three major things leap out at me: 1. Too many of the grid’s controls are unclear making for poor UX. e.g. It was unclear to me that I had to close the Add to Site pane in order to access the new post button. The pane should be clearly different from the background, and should auto close when clicked off</p><p>Powerful closing here…</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20">Founding Members,</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

We aren’t trying to be or beat Squarespace, Wordpress or WIX. What we are building is a different animal. A platform shaped by your content. Today, with one click, Grid users can send content to their site from any digital source; photos from an iPhone, videos from an Android device, any piece of content from anywhere on the web. From there, our AI tools are analyzing the color and context of photos, the length and language of text and the preferences set for fonts, brand and layout to deliver a site that would’ve taken thousands of dollars or hundreds of hours to achieve with existing tools and services. We aren’t happy with the results yet. But the foundation has been laid and the plumbing is in and with the help of the feedback we are receiving, it’s only a matter of time.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"2b9f7d28-7c32-42e9-aa4e-278b417093b5","item":"bbc36b5f-deb8-4484-b852-d46f7958e7de","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2015-10-19T05:07:24.049Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"Frankly, we were worried that when we finally activated you, you would hate where we’ve taken things.
